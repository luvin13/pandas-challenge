# pandas-challenge

Worked analytics for HeroesofPymoli a multiplayer game that includes microtransactions. 

Performed analysis on:
Player Count
Purchases
Gender Demographics
Age Demographics
Popular/Profitable Items
Top spenders
using DataFrames with pandas in Python.

Use of groupbys to sort data regarding to unique values as well as sorting purchases by gender or age.

note: Did not push multiple commits because I saved my data locally and pushed it when it was completed hence why there are only 2 commits to the repository.
